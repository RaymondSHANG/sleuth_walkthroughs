# sleuth walkthroughs

This repository contained several walkthroughs for **[sleuth](http://pachterlab.github.io/sleuth/)**. They teach various use cases for sleuth and provide guidance on solutions for frequently tackled problems.

## Specifications for a walkthrough

- A directory with a useful title
- An `R/analysis.Rmd` file containing the main analysis
- **Each sentence should be on a different line to facilitate version control** 
- The result of that analysis in `analysis.html`
- A script to execute all of this analysis (preferably with snakemake)
