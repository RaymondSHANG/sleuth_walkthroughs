# sleuth tutorials

This repository contained several tutorials for the RNA-Seq differential expression analysis tool, **[sleuth](http://pachterlab.github.io/sleuth/)**.

## Requirements

- A directory with a useful title
- A `R/analysis.Rmd` file containing the main analysis
- **Each sentence should be on a different line to make version control easier to deal with**
- The result of that analysis in `analysis.html`
- A script to execute all of this analysis (preferably with snakemake)

Everything else is optional to create a relatively unrestrictive environment.
